# Neos Mod Manifest

A community-managed listing of [NeosModLoader](https://github.com/zkxs/NeosModLoader) mods. If you have more items for the list, please [open a PR](docs/submission-tutorial.md). If you want to get update notifications join [our Discord](https://discord.gg/vCDJK9xyvm).

The below list is automatically generated from a machine-readable [manifest](manifest.json) with github actions. The [schema documentation](docs/schema.md) explains what the fields in the manifest mean. Having a machine-readable manifest is an important step towards our planned mod manager and auto-updater software.
